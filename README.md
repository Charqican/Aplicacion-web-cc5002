The project is an interface for users to make donations or requests for vegetables, fruits, or other types of food. The users are able to see what other donations or requests are in the database and get information on them by clicking.Â 

The homepage has a navigation bar to access the rest of the site as well as a map that displays the last 5 donations and requests as markers; those markers are clickable, and when the user do so, it shows information about the request or donation.To make a donation or a request, the user can use the homepage navigation bar to enter the respective form. There's also a page that has a simple bar chart with the count of the types of donations and requests.
