# Web Application CC5002 2023

This is a web app developed during 2023 as a course project. The idea was to understand how web applications were built, the tools that are used and considerations for security.

## About the repository 

This repo contains the source code of the web page and the backend, wich is built using flask. 

## The project 

The project is an interface for users to make donations or requests for vegetables, fruits, or other types of food. The users are able to see what other donations or requests are in the database and get information on them by clicking.Â 

The homepage has a navigation bar to access the rest of the site as well as a map that displays the last 5 donations and requests as markers; those markers are clickable, and when the user do so, it shows information about the request or donation.To make a donation or a request, the user can use the homepage navigation bar to enter the respective form. There's also a page that has a simple bar chart with the count of the types of donations and requests.

## Future

My idea is to keep updating the repository until I'm satisfied with the end result, there's a long time for that though as there's a lot of things to change and add.

Things I want to implement in the near future:

*  Use Bootstrap to add a nicer look to the page and other functionalities
*  Refactor the db.py to make cleaner code
*  Add more security
*  Implement validations (backend)
*  Allow users to registrate and login
